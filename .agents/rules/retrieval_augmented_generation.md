## Upstream Summary

- Knowledge stored in model parameters is hard to access precisely; giving provenance for outputs and updating world knowledge are open problems for parametric-only models.
- RAG pairs parametric memory (a pre-trained seq2seq model) with non-parametric memory (a dense vector index of Wikipedia read through a pre-trained neural retriever). One formulation uses the same retrieved passages for the whole output; the other may use different passages per token.
- RAG models set the state of the art on three open-domain QA tasks and produced more specific, diverse, and factual text than a parametric-only seq2seq baseline.

## Core Requirements

1. **Retrieve From the Right Source:**
   - Code structure and impact → `graphify-out/graph.json` (`graphify query`, `explain`, `affected`) and `.agents/context/code_graph_wiki.md`.
   - Domain rules (the `7zz` command contract, sandbox and quarantine architecture, Finder integration, release signing) → `.agents/AGENTS.md` and `.agents/context/domain_wiki.md`.
   - 7-Zip behavior → `Vendor/7-Zip/MANUAL`, `Vendor/7-Zip/History.txt`, and the provenance in `Vendor/7-Zip/SOURCE.txt`.
   - State flows → `.agents/context/symbolic_memory_graph.md`.
   - Past failures, rejected ideas, and planned work → `.agents/context/reflexion_memory_log.md`, `.agents/context/user_rejected_spec.md`, and `.agents/context/roadmap.md`.
2. **Cite Provenance:** Claims about code or engine behavior in plans, reviews, and docs name the file (and line, when it matters) they came from.
3. **Source Beats Memory:** When a retrieved source and a memory asset disagree, the source wins and the stale asset is corrected in the same change.
4. **Check Freshness:** Compare the `Built at commit` line in `code_graph_wiki.md` (and `Built from commit` in `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md`) with `git rev-parse HEAD` before relying on it; rebuild the graph when they differ after structural changes.
5. **Retrieval Stays Local:** Archive names, paths, and contents from the user's Mac are not sent to external tools or services for retrieval.
