> **Change Summary:** 2026-11-04: rewritten from the 2026-11-03 standards review; upstream summary carried over without a new fetch; recorded as out of scope (Harmony applies only to the open-weight gpt-oss models, and neither this repository nor Arhivar uses them).

## Upstream Summary

- Harmony is the response format for OpenAI's open-weight gpt-oss models. The README says gpt-oss should not be used without it, because the models will not work correctly. Inference providers such as Hugging Face, Ollama and vLLM apply the format for the caller.
- Messages carry the roles system, developer, user and assistant, each wrapped in `<|start|>` and `<|end|>` tokens.
- There are three channels: `analysis` (chain of thought), `commentary` (tool-calling preambles) and `final` (regular responses). Every message must name its channel.
- Tools are declared in the developer message under a namespace, using TypeScript-style definitions. Calls to them go to the `commentary` channel.
- The library renders and parses the format. Its core is written in Rust, it has Python bindings, and it is licensed Apache-2.0.

## Core Requirements

1. **Not Applicable to This Repository:** Arhivar runs no model inference and renders no prompts. The agents working on this repository are not gpt-oss models. Do not add `openai-harmony` or any other Harmony renderer to `Package.swift` or `Scripts/`.
2. **If a gpt-oss Agent Is Used Later:** Its `commentary` tool calls follow the same consent rules as any other tool call (`model_context_protocol.md`, `openai_model_spec.md`). Formatting is left to the inference provider.
