> **Change Summary:** 2026-11-04: rewritten from the 2026-11-03 standards review (formerly `aws_agent_governance.md`); upstream summary carried over without a new fetch; Arhivar requirements rewritten (Arhivar uses no AWS service).

## Upstream Summary

- AgentCore is an agentic platform for building, deploying, and operating agents with any framework and foundation model; its services work together or independently. The overview lists Harness, Runtime, Memory, Gateway, Identity, Code Interpreter, Browser, Observability, Payments, Evaluations, Optimization, Policy, and Registry.
- Policy gives deterministic control: rules written in natural language or a Cedar-compatible policy language are enforced through Gateway, which intercepts every tool call before it runs.
- Runtime provides session isolation; Identity handles agent identity, access, and authentication with existing identity providers.
- Observability traces each step so intermediate outputs can be audited (OpenTelemetry-compatible). Evaluations measure task execution, edge-case handling, and output reliability before and after deployment.
- Amazon Bedrock Agents (launched November 2023) is now Bedrock Agents Classic, in maintenance mode: closed to new customers from 2026-07-30, existing agents keep working, no new features, no planned end-of-life. AWS recommends migrating to AgentCore.
- Not stated on the canonical page, so not adopted here: an AWS document called a "governance standard". The page describes a platform of services; the Classic status comes from the second page above.

## Core Requirements

1. **Policy Before Every Side Effect:** Each command that changes files or system state is checked against fixed rules before it runs: no `rm -rf` outside the repository's build outputs or the session scratchpad, no change that starts `7zz` outside `sandbox-exec` by default or puts a password on its command line, no RAR creation, and no silent `sudo`. A match blocks the command; it is not traded off against convenience. Inside the app the same idea holds: while `sandboxEngine` is on (the default), every `7zz` run goes through `AppModel.confined(...)` and its `SandboxProfile`, and `CommandRunner` fails closed with `SevenZipError.sandboxUnavailable` when `sandbox-exec` cannot start.
2. **Trace What Ran:** The task report lists the commands run and their results; failures and corrections go into `reflexion_memory_log.md`. Inside the app, `CommandRunner` logs every run through `AppLog` with the program and subcommand only (`logLabel`: no paths, passwords, or item names), its exit code, and its duration.
3. **Evaluate Before and After:** Changes are evaluated before they ship (`swift test`; `./Scripts/build_app.sh` and `./Scripts/verify_bundle.sh` for bundle changes; `./Scripts/stress-test.sh` before a release when the user runs it), and outcomes are reported as they happened. Partial or failed results are never described as success, in an agent's report or in the app's UI text (a `7zz` warning exit stays a warning).
4. **Least-Privilege Identity:** Agents work as the user's normal account with the narrowest access the task needs. They never read or send `~/.ssh`, `~/.gnupg`, `~/.aws`, or `~/Library/Keychains`, never touch the release signing key outside `Scripts/update_signing.swift` run by the user, and never store cloud credentials in the repository.
5. **No Cloud Agent in the App:** Adding AWS SDKs, AgentCore, or any hosted agent service to Arhivar breaks the on-device rule in `apple_app_intents_agent.md` and needs an explicit user decision first.
