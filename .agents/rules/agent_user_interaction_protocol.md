# Agent-User Interaction Protocol Standard (`agent_user_interaction_protocol.md`)

> **Upstream Source:** <https://docs.ag-ui.com> (repository: `ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui`)
> **Version / Date:** The docs show no protocol version; repository releases are date-tagged (latest `release/2026-11-03`), and `@ag-ui/core` 1.0.3 shipped in `release/2026-10-16`
> **Last Reviewed:** 2026-11-04
> **Change Summary:** 2026-11-04: rewritten from the 2026-11-03 standards review; upstream summary carried over without a new fetch; Arhivar requirements rewritten for how coding agents report to the user (Arhivar has no AG-UI client, server, or event stream).

## Upstream Summary

- AG-UI is "an open, lightweight, event-based protocol that standardizes how AI agents connect to user-facing applications"; the docs say it "was born from CopilotKit's initial partnership with LangChain and CrewAI." It builds on HTTP and WebSockets.
- Event categories: lifecycle (`RunStarted`, `RunFinished`, `RunError`, `StepStarted`, `StepFinished`), text message, tool call, state management (`StateSnapshot`, `StateDelta` as RFC 6902 JSON Patch, `MessagesSnapshot`), activity, subagent, reasoning, and `Raw`/`Custom`. The `THINKING_*` events are deprecated for removal in 1.0.0.
- Building blocks include shared state, frontend tool calls as typed handoffs, and Interrupts that let a user pause, approve, edit, retry, or escalate mid-flow.
- The docs place AG-UI at agent-to-user, MCP at agent-to-tools and data, and A2A at agent-to-agent; A2UI is a separate generative UI specification that works with AG-UI. The docs name no foundation or governance body.

## Core Requirements

1. **Every Run Ends Honestly:** Like `RunFinished` versus `RunError`, a turn ends by saying what finished and what failed. A failed or skipped step is never summarized as done.
2. **State Matches Reality:** Task lists and progress updates are snapshots of what actually happened; a step is marked complete only after its check ran.
3. **One Decision per Interrupt:** When work needs the user, pause at that point with one clear question (approve, edit, retry, or stop) instead of continuing and asking afterward or bundling several approvals.
4. **Reasoning Is Not Evidence:** Results cite command output, diffs, and file paths, not the agent's own reasoning text.
5. **No Agent Runtime in the App:** The Arhivar UI talks only to its own engine (`AppModel` driving `7zz` through `CommandRunner`). Adding an AG-UI client or event stream needs an explicit user decision first.
